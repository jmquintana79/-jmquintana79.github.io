### "As researchers our main job is to have useful ideas that advance knowledge. These ideas always come from somewhere hidden in our brain and we must cultivate our ability to give that idea-generation process enough time. You need space in your week to think, to not work on programming or writing or even reading. Just think about the big questions that bug you."

> Yoshua Bengio

### “Saber mucho no es lo mismo que ser inteligente. La inteligencia no es sólo información, sino también juicio para manejarla”

> Carl Sagan
